MARKET LIST

This application is for the Burlington, NC Food Co-op to allow the market manager to source as much produce as possible from local farmers and producers with as little friction as possible.  

* Local farmers/producers should need no more than 5-10 minutes a week to review the request list and select their commitments. 
* The market manager can easily create order lists with products that can have variable prices each week and different prices for certified organic produce and non-certified local produce.
* Farmers and managers have access to easily-printable invoices for each week.
